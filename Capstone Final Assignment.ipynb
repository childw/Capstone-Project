    "The owners of a Michelin rated restaurant – Ears Down Ox (fictitious) –  in Washington, DC are looking to open another restaurant in one of three neighborhoods in close proximity to their current facility:  Columbia Heights, Dupont Circle, and the U Street Corridor.   \n",
    "The fine-dining restaurant will only be open from 5PM-11PM Tuesday through Sunday and the menu will consist primarily of American Fare.  Restaurant revenue per seat will average 50 dollars placing the restaurant in the 3 dollar-sign ($$$) category on yelp.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The owners of Ears Down Rabbit have a preference for Columbia Heights, Dupont Circle, and the U Street Corridor in order to optimize for staffing and delivery logistics.  Sharing wait and kitchen staff across Ears Down Rabbit and the new restaurant is a top priority.  They would also like to use the same food supplier and work with similar delivery times at both facilities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "All three areas in Washington, DC have a robust and vibrant restaurant and nightlife scene and the owners are aware that they have to balance their efficiency needs with close proximity to the competition.  They have asked us to recommend where they should open their next restaurant: Columbia Heights, Dupont Circle, or the U Street Corridor. \n",

    "This analysis could easily be extended to other neighborhoods in Washington, DC or could be replicated for other new restaurants with different menus and strategies.  \n"

The data includes neighborhoods beyond our 3 targets, in the event that we want to provide additional insight to our client.  "
